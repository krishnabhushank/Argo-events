# Traceability and Retry

To trace events as they occur and handle failures with the ability to redo events in Argo Events, you need to implement robust logging, monitoring, and retry mechanisms. Hereâ€™s how you can achieve this:

### 1. Tracing Events

#### Enable Detailed Logging

- Ensure that detailed logging is enabled for your Argo Events components (event sources, sensors, and gateways). This will help you trace events as they occur.
- Use a centralized logging system like Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK) stack to collect and visualize logs.

Example: Enabling logging for a sensor:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sensor
metadata:
  name: traceable-sensor
spec:
  dependencies:
    - name: example
      eventSourceName: example-event-source
      eventName: example
  triggers:
    - template:
        name: example-trigger
        k8s:
          group: argoproj.io
          version: v1alpha1
          resource: workflows
          operation: create
          source:
            resource:
              apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
              kind: Workflow
              metadata:
                generateName: example-workflow-
              spec:
                entrypoint: main
                templates:
                  - name: main
                    container:
                      image: my-image
                      command: ["sh", "-c"]
                      args: ["echo 'Example event triggered'"]
  logging:
    format: json
    level: debug
```

#### Use External Event Logging

- Use an external system to log and trace events, such as Kafka or an external database, where each event and its metadata can be logged as it flows through the system.

### 2. Handling Failures and Redoing Events

#### Implement Retry Mechanisms

- Argo Events supports retry policies for sensors and triggers. You can specify retry strategies to handle transient failures.

Example: Adding retry policy to a sensor:
```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Sensor
metadata:
  name: retryable-sensor
spec:
  dependencies:
    - name: example
      eventSourceName: example-event-source
      eventName: example
  triggers:
    - template:
        name: example-trigger
        k8s:
          group: argoproj.io
          version: v1alpha1
          resource: workflows
          operation: create
          source:
            resource:
              apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
              kind: Workflow
              metadata:
                generateName: example-workflow-
              spec:
                entrypoint: main
                templates:
                  - name: main
                    container:
                      image: my-image
                      command: ["sh", "-c"]
                      args: ["echo 'Example event triggered'"]
  errorOnFailedRound: true
  retryStrategy:
    steps: 3
    duration: "5s"
    backoff: exponential
```

#### Manual Redo of Events

- For manual redoing of events, store event metadata (e.g., event payload, timestamps) in a durable storage (e.g., database, S3).
- Create a mechanism to re-inject these events into the event source when needed.

Example: Manual event reinjection:
```sh
# Assuming you have stored the event payloads
kubectl create -f stored-event-payload.yaml
```

### 3. Monitoring and Alerts

#### Prometheus and Grafana

- Use Prometheus to scrape metrics from Argo Events and visualize them in Grafana. Set up alerts based on these metrics to detect failures and anomalies.

Example: Prometheus scrape configuration:
```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: sensor-service
  annotations:
    prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'
    prometheus.io/port: 'metrics'
spec:
  ports:
    - port: 9090
  selector:
    app: sensor
```

#### Alerts with Alertmanager

- Configure Prometheus Alertmanager to send alerts based on failure metrics.

Example: Alert configuration:
```yaml
groups:
  - name: argo-events-alerts
    rules:
      - alert: SensorFailure
        expr: argo_events_sensor_failures_total > 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
          severity: critical
        annotations:
          summary: "Sensor has failed"
          description: "Sensor {{ $labels.sensor }} has failed {{ $value }} times."
```

### 4. Visualization with Argo Events UI

- Use the Argo Events UI to visualize the event flow and monitor the status of event sources and sensors. This UI can help you trace the events and identify where failures occur.

### Example Scenario

1. **Event Source:** A webhook event source receives an event.
2. **First Sensor:** Processes the event and logs details.
3. **Retry on Failure:** If the sensor fails to process the event, it retries based on the defined strategy.
4. **Next Event Source:** On successful processing, triggers the next event source or sensor.
5. **Manual Intervention:** If needed, manually re-inject events using stored event metadata.

By implementing these strategies, you can trace events as they occur, handle failures gracefully with retry mechanisms, and manually redo events when necessary, ensuring robust and observable event-driven workflows with Argo Events.
