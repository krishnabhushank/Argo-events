For Argo Events using NATS JetStream as the `EventBus` backend, the process to disable TLS is similar but with specific configurations tailored for JetStream. Here’s how you can disable TLS for JetStream in your `EventBus` configuration:

### Step-by-Step Guide to Disable TLS for JetStream

#### 1. Modify the EventBus Configuration for JetStream

You can configure your `EventBus` to use NATS JetStream without TLS by specifying the appropriate settings in the `EventBus` custom resource.

Here’s an example YAML configuration for JetStream with TLS disabled:

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: EventBus
metadata:
  name: my-jetstream-eventbus
spec:
  nats:
    jetstream:
      version: "2.7.1"  # or whichever version you're using
      replicas: 3
      auth:
        basic:
          username: nats-user
          password: nats-password
      # Disable TLS
      tls:
        enabled: false
```

#### 2. Apply the Configuration

Apply this configuration to your Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubectl apply -f jetstream-eventbus-without-tls.yaml
```

This will configure the NATS JetStream server to run without TLS.

### Verification

1. **Check EventBus Status:**
   Verify that the `EventBus` is configured correctly by checking its status:

   ```sh
   kubectl get eventbus my-jetstream-eventbus -o yaml
   ```

2. **Inspect NATS JetStream Deployment:**
   Ensure that the NATS JetStream deployment is running with TLS disabled by describing the deployment:

   ```sh
   kubectl describe deployment -n argo-events my-jetstream-eventbus-nats
   ```

### Considerations

- **Security Implications:** Disabling TLS means that data exchanged between components will not be encrypted. This might not be suitable for production environments where security is a concern. Ensure that this configuration meets your security requirements.
- **Namespace and EventBus Binding:** Ensure that your event sources, sensors, and other components are correctly pointing to this `EventBus`.

### Summary

Disabling TLS for JetStream in Argo Events is similar to disabling TLS for the native NATS setup. You simply adjust the `tls` section in the `EventBus` configuration to `enabled: false`. This change will configure the NATS JetStream server to operate without TLS encryption.
